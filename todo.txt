To Do:
  Change to Typescript
  Clean up code and refactor
  Deal with ssh vs http for git commands
  Create shortcut addition tool: 'wk set' and 'wk unset'
  Better help and documentation
    Add to commands interface a help line
  Arg handling system
    function like: validateArgs(args, expectedCount: number, regex: regex[])
      ...And count has to match, each arg has to match each regexp
  Config reader/writer
    Have one master config JSON with Interface
    On get(), read the whole file again
    On set(), write the whoel file again

Ideas:
  Git:
    On pushall, check branch and set upstream
