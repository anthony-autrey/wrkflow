To Do:
  Deal with ssh vs http for git commands
  Create shortcut addition tool: 'wk set' and 'wk unset'
  Better help and documentation

Ideas:
  Git:
    On pushall, check branch and set upstream
  Main:
    Ask: if no results, no 'No related topics'

    ls: allow for traversal like ask
  General:
    Create shortcut addition tool: 'wk set' and 'wk unset'
